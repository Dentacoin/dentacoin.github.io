                    <p class="offset-top-50"> This Privacy Policy applies to the Dentacoin B.V. owned and operated applications, 
                        websites and its subdomains (“Sites and Applications”). Dentacoin B.V. (“Dentacoin” “we,” or “us”) knows 
                        that you care how information about you is used, stored, and shared. 

                    </p> 
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what personal data of yours will be collected by us when you access the Sites
                         and Applications, how the data will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of data.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an 
                        identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an 
                        identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors 
                        specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                    </p> 
                    <p>This Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                    </p> 
                    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
                         We will not use or share your personal data with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>The use of personal data collected through our Sites and Applications shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy.

                    <h5><strong>1. Data Protection Overview</strong></h5>
                    <p>The operators of all Dentacoin Sites and Applications take the protection of your personal data very seriously. 
                        We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.
                    </p> 
                    <p>If you use any of our Sites and Applications, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data
                         with which you could be personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for.
                          It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Please note that data transmitted via the Internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches.
                         Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.
                    </p> 
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
                    </p> 
                    <h4>Who is responsible for the data collection on our Sites and Applications?</h4>
                    <p>The data collected on our Sites and Applications is processed by the Data Operator. 
                        The operator's contact details can be found in the legal notice on Dentacoin’s official website www.dentacoin.com.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Dentacoin Foundation operates the majority of its services as a data controller. However, there are some instances 
                        in which we operate as a data processor - e.g. in cases of surveys published on DentaVox, which are ordered by third-parties.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>

                   <p>We collect data when you register, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey, or send an inquiry.</p> 
                    <p>Part of this data (including your name, email, phone number, friend list) is provided 
                        by third parties (such as Facebook, Civic, uPort) during the registration process, upon your explicit consent. 
                        </p>
                     <p>Other data is collected automatically by our
                         IT systems when you visit our Sites and Applications
                          (primarily technical data such as which browser and operating system you are using, when you accessed the website, etc.).
                        </p>   
                    <h4>What do we use your data for? </h4>
                    <p>We collect your data in order to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li type="square">ensure the proper functioning of our Sites and Applications;</li>
                        <li type="square">give you access to the full range of functionalities 
                            (such as answering questionnaires and earning  Dentacoin tokens, 
                            writing reviews, using the Dentacare mobile app, etc.);</li>
                        <li type="square">answer your inquiries;</li>
                        <li type="square">send you service information and newsletters;</li>
                        <li type="square">conduct market research;</li>
                        <li type="square">analyze the overall user behaviour.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal data to any third party individual, government agency, or company at any time unless compelled to do so by law.</p>
                    <h4>How do we protect your data?</h4>
                    <p>Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights 
                        to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. </p>
                        <p>All sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology or TLS encryption for security reasons and for 
                            the protection of the transmission of confidential content. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when
                             it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, 
                             the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties. </p>
                             <p>We use regular Malware Scanning. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their
                                  information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
                    <h4>How long do we keep your data?</h4>
                        <p>Your data is retained until you explicitly express that you want us to delete your data or you delete it on your own using the designated option in
                             your Profile on our Sites and Applications. By deleting your Profile on our Sites and Applications you are exercising your right “to be forgotten”
                              and we have the obligation to erase your personal data.   </p>
                    <h5><strong>2. What rights do you have regarding you data</strong></h5>
                    <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. 
                        You also have the right to request it to be corrected, restricted, or deleted (those options are available to you in Your profile as well). 
                        You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection.
                         You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
                    <h4>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h4>
                    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. 
                        An informal email expressing this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                    <h4>Information, restriction, deletion</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin,
                         the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, restricted or deleted
                          (those options are available to you in Your profile as well). You can contact us at any time using the email address given in our legal notice 
                          if you have further questions related to your personal data.</p>
                    <h4>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h4>
                    <p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
                    <h4>Right to data portability</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract delivered to yourself or to a third 
                        party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be 
                        done to the extent technically feasible. </p>
                    <h4>Analytics and third-party tools</h4>
                    <p>When visiting our Sites and Applications, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing behavior. This happens primarily using 
                        cookies and analytics tools. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually anonymous, i.e. we will not be able to 
                        identify your identity from this data. When created, cookies normally don't contain any personal information. 
                        They don't scan your computer or do any kind of investigation to find out your personal information. Any personal 
                        information they might contain is a result of your own input on a website's form. Most of the time, when a cookie does
                         store personal information, this information is coded in such a way that it is unreadable to any third party who happens 
                         to access your cookie folder. </p>
                    <p>You can object to this analysis. We will inform you further below about how to exercise your options in this regard.</p>
                    <h5><strong>3. Data Collection</strong></h5>
                    <h4>Account Data</h4>
                    <p>Personal data such as email address, age, city, country, mobile phone number is requested from you when registering
                         on any of our Sites and Applications. This data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of our Sites and 
                         Applications; it allows you to access  certain parts of our Sites and Applications, to use the full range of 
                         functionalities they offer (such as answering DentaVox questionnaires, earning Dentacoin tokens, writing reviews 
                         on our Trusted Review Platform, enhancing your oral hygiene routine by means of the Dentacare mobile app, etc.),
                          as well as to receive service information and newsletters. Other data can be used to analyze how you use our Sites 
                          and Applications, as well as for market research purposes.</p>
                     <p>For account creation, verification and login we use the services of third-party service providers - Facebook, Civic and uPort.</p>  
                     <h4>Facebook Login </h4>
                     <p>Our Sites and Applications use Facebook Login. The service is provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").
                        </p>   
                    <p>Facebook Login allows you to quickly and easily create an account and login without having to set (and likely later forget)
                         another password. When creating your account on our Sites and Applications, you will be asked for specific permissions about
                          the data you allow us to use from your Facebook profile. No other data from your Facebook profile will be collected without your explicit consent. </p>
                    <p>You can discontinue at any time the integration of your Facebook profile with our Sites and Applications or edit your permissions by following the 
                        instructions specified here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/262314300536014">https://www.facebook.com/help/262314300536014/</a> </p>
                    <p>Please check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/"> https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a> </p>
                    <h4>Civic Login </h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Civic for account creation and verification. The service is provided by Civic Technologies, 
                        Inc., 540 Bryant Street, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94301, United States. </p>
                    <p>Civic allows you to register and authenticate without the need for usernames and passwords, and verify your identity using blockchain-powered 
                        attestations. Users store their identity data, documents and attestations using the Civic App and can reuse the attestations when needed. When
                         creating your account on our Sites and Applications, you will be asked for specific permissions about the data you allow us to use from your Civic 
                         decentralized ID. No other data from your Civic ID will be collected without your explicit consent. </p>
                      <p>Please check out Civic's privacy policy to learn more: <a href="https://www.civic.com/legal/privacy-policy/"> https://www.civic.com/legal/privacy-policy/ </a></p>  
                    <h4>uPort Login</h4> 
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use uPort for account creation and verification. uPort is developed and powered by ConsenSys Corporation, based in Brooklyn, 
                        New York City, USA. </p>
                    <p>uPort provides a digital identity platform and application which enable users to control their own identity and accounts, secure their keys, manage 
                        and give permission to their personal data, and legally sign transactions. When creating your account on our Sites and Applications, you will 
                        be asked for specific permissions about the data you allow us to retrieve and use from your uPort decentralized ID. No other data from your uPort
                         ID will be collected without your explicit consent. </p>
                    <p>Please check out uPort's privacy policy to learn more: <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/privacy-policy"> https://github.com/uport-project/privacy-policy </a></p>
                    <h4>Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Some of our Sites and Applications use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. 
                        Cookies help make our Sites and Applications more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files 
                        that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
                        </p>
                    <p>Most of the cookies we use are the so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted after you leave our websites and 
                        their subdomains. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them.. These cookies enable our websites to recognize your
                         browser (device) and previous activity the next time you visit them.</p>
                    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept 
                        or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always
                         reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our Sites and Applications.</p>
                    <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1,
                         letter f of GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free
                          of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this Privacy 
                          Policy.</p>
                    <h4>Server log files</h4>

                            <h5><strong>4. Data Collected for Market Research Purposes</strong></h5>
                            <p>We collect data for market research purposes from subscribers (data subjects) taking incentivized online surveys on our market research platform DentaVox. 
                                The collection and use of personal data (incl. survey answers) on DentaVox is performed in compliance with the GDPR Guidance Note for the Research Sector,
                                 compiled jointly by the European Research Federation (EFAMRO) and ESOMAR - the global voice of the data, research and insights community. </p>
                            <p>All surveys taken as well as the respective answers given by a respondent are associated with her/his DentaVox account. Hence they can also be considered personal data (in terms of database / storage).
                                 The respondent can request all this data (both personal details and survey answers) to be edited, withdrawn or deleted at any time by contacting us at the email 
                                 provided in the legal notice or using the designated options in their online Profile.</p>
                                <p>If the survey responses, however, have already been incorporated and anonymized or aggregated in a market, opinion or social research project (like it is in the case of DentaVox), then this data does 
                                    not have to be deleted as it’s not personal data. The aggregated and anonymized survey results can hence be provided to third parties such as partners, media, etc.</p>
                                <p>If a participant communicates his/her opposition to the processing of his/her data, we will facilitate this by not further processing identification data.</p>
                            <h5><strong>5. Analytics and advertising</strong></h5>
                            <h4 style="color:#126585">Google Analytics</h4>
                            <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                            <p>Google Analytics uses the so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your device and that enable the us to analyze you user behaviour on our Sites and Applications. 
                                The information generated by the cookie about your use is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
                            <p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize online services 
                                 and advertising activities.</p>
                            <h4>IP anonymization</h4>     
                            <p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on our Sites and Applications. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to 
                                the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the 
                                US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of our Sites and Applications to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports
                                 on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the Sites and Applications’ operator . The IP address transmitted 
                                 by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
                            <h4>Browser plugin</h4>
                            <p>You can disable cookies / prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, be aware that doing so you may not be able to enjoy 
                                the full functionality of our Sites and Applications. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of Dentacoin websites (incl. your IP address)

                                <h4>Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</h4>
                                <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising
                                     from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by 
                                     adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".</p>
                                <h4>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h4>
                                <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program developed by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, 
                                    CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
                                    <p>As part of Google AdWords services/tools, we use the so-called “conversion tracking”. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. 
                                        These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>
                                        <p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
                                             Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this 
                                             by simply disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie in your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
                                        <p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize user 
                                            experience and advertising.</p>
                                            <p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=de"> https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=de </a>.</p>
                                            <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to
                                                 automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our Sites and Applications.</p>
                                            <h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
                                            <p>We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our Sites and Applications. This service is provided by Google Inc., 
                                                1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
                                            <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our Sites and Applications (e.g. a contact or registration form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. 
                                                This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis is then  forwarded to Google.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place.</p>
                                                <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a legitimate interest in protecting them from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>

                                            <p>Our Sites and Applications measure conversions using visitor action pixels provided by  Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").</p>
                                            <p>These pixels allow the tracking  of site visitors’ behaviour after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness 
                                                of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.</p>
                                            <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as an operator of our Sites and Applications and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own
                                                 advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.</p>

                                            <p>Our Sites and Applications use the services of MailChimp to send newsletters.
                                                 This service is provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.</p>
                                            <p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide data (e.g. your email address)
                                                 to subscribe to our Newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.</p>
                                                <p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</p>
                                            <p>We use MailChimp also to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you clicked on. In addition, technical
                                                 information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient.
                                                  It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p>
